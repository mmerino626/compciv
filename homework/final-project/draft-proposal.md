I am interested in creating a tool to help me with a research project I am working on in another class; a project illustrating abortion as an issue that the media helped perpetuate as belonging to Wendy Davis. I will first create a shell script that will download the archives of the following top news sources in Texas --as deemed by circulation rates, and reader subscriptions, etc-- Texas Tribune, Texas Monthly, Dallas Morning News, Austin American Statesman, San Antonio Express News, and the Houston Chronicle.Then, I will create another shell script that will take these archives, and parse through them by going through each headline and searching for Wendy Davis first, and then Wendy Davis and abortion terms. Then the script will automatize and create an echo statement that will print to the user a proportion illustrating the number of articles with mention of both/total number of articles with just the name for each news source. This is meant to illustrate how closely tied Wendy Davis is to the issue of abortion, and which newspapers perpetuated this relationship the most, a fact which I am illustrating in my research project. These results will update to a webpage that I will create, where the results and proportions listed in order of lowest to highest will be displayed. I will then twist the project into a more general direction, where a user can enter in any two fields and see how inter-related they are amongst these Texas-based news sources on this website.
